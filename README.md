# ComfyUI-Runpod-worker
Yet another Runpod template for running ComfyUI. Send a workflow JSON and associated inputs, Runpod runs it and returns the workflow outputs.

Thanks a lot to [blib-la](https://github.com/blib-la/), this repo borrows a lot from their [runpod worker for ComfyUI](https://github.com/blib-la/runpod-worker-comfy).
